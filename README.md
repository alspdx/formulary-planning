**Name of Student:** Adam Smith

**Name of Project:** “Formulary"

**Project’s Purpose or Goal:** A client service history management system for hairstylists.

**List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:**

• As a user, I want to be able to access a list of client profiles.

• As a user, I want to be able to click on a client profile and get details about that client.

• As a user, I want to be able to see a history of services for each client, including formula notes.

**What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.**

• React/Redux!

• Firebase database through Re-Base or something similar.

**If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.**

• As a user, I want to be able to log in to my account with email and password.

• As a user, I want to be able to save an image with each set of service notes to recall at a later time.

• As a user, I want to be able to use the this service as a mobile app.

• As a user, I want to be able to tag images with keywords that can be searched to find formulas and service notes without having to search though client profiles.

• As a user, I want to be able to share formulas and service notes with other users (other stylists).

**What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?**

• User profiles with login will require some sort of authentication service. Firebase? Auth0?

• Images will require some sort of online storage, maybe Firebase storage.

• Mobile will require React Native.

**Is there anything else you’d like your instructor to know?**
I’m not super concerned about meeting MVP. Long term I would love to develop this app for mobile, as the user story is a lot stronger from that perspective. I have a lot of stylists in my life who love to brainstorm and daydream so there will be no shortage if ideas for new features to implement if/when the time comes.
